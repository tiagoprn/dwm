- [ ] Remove the keyboard shortcuts that I will not use
- [ ] Add commands I have associated to bindsyms on dot_files/raspberry/pii/i3/config as modifiers on dwm

- [ ] Configure dwm autostart, with all programs that also start on i3 (maybe use `/usr/bin/startdwm`?).

- [ ] Add comments to all bindings on config.h, so that I can run with a rofi cheatsheet (copy from vim.cheatsheet)

- [ ] Instalar e configurar o khal e o vdirsyncer para o scratchpad do personal-calendar funcionar.
