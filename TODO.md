- [ ] `TODO.port-from-i3.md`: Port i3 bindsyms
- [ ] Instalar e configurar o khal e o vdirsyncer para o scratchpad do personal-calendar funcionar.
- [ ] Check if scratchpads for vim and personal-calendar are opened floating with urxvt on picom with no transparency
- [ ] Bring some i3 bindsyms to dwm using shkxd?
- [x] Create a binding on dwm to run the dwm cheatsheet
- [x] Add comments to all bindings on config.h, so that I can run with a rofi cheatsheet (copy from vim.cheatsheet)
- [x] Remap mod+d to run the rofi apps menu, and mod+shift+d to run dmenu
- [x] Remap mod+z as on i3, and change the logoff dwm command if os=raspbian (`loginctl terminate-user pi`)
- [x] Configure dwm autostart on `startdwm`
- [x] Remove the keyboard shortcuts that I will not use
- [x] Remove garbage from dwmblocks, organize and keep it more minimal.
- [x] Move the script I used on i3blocks (load average, memory, caps lock etc to dwmblocks.
