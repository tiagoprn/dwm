- [ ] Configure dwm autostart, with all programs that also start on i3 (maybe use `/usr/bin/startdwm`?).
- [ ] Keep the scratchpad that has the floating terminal to call lxsession, and use the other one for the vim notes.
- [ ] Open the vim-notes with lxterminal, with no transparency on picom
- [ ] Remove the keyboard shortcuts that I will not use
- [ ] bring some i3 bindsyms to dwm using shkxd
- [x] Remove garbage from dwmblocks, keep it more minimal.
- [x] Move the script I used on i3blocks (load average, memory, caps lock etc to dwmblocks.
