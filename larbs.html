<p>Use vim keys (h/j/k/l) to navigate this document.
Pressing s will fit it to window width (a to revert). K and
J zoom in and out. Super+f to toggle fullscreen. q to quit.
(These are general binds set for <b>zathura</b>, the pdf
reader.) Mod+F1 will show this document at any time. By Mod,
I mean the Super Key, usually known as &quot;the Windows
Key.&quot; FAQs are at the end of this document.
<b>Naturalness</b> &ndash; Remove the border between mind
and matter: everything important should be as few keypresses
as possible away from you, and you shouldn&rsquo;t have to
think about what you&rsquo;re doing. Immersion.
<b>Economy</b> &ndash; Programs should be simple and light
on system resources and highly extensible. Because of this,
many are terminal or small ncurses programs that have all
the magic inside of them. <b>Keyboard/vim-centrality</b>
&ndash; All terminal programs (and other programs) use vim
keys when possible. Your hands never need leave the home row
or thereabout. <b>Decentralization</b> &ndash; This system
is a web of small, modifiable and replaceable programs that
users can easily customize. Capslock is a useless key in
high quality space. It&rsquo;s now remapped. If you press it
alone, it will function as escape, making vimcraft much more
natural, but you can also hold it down and it will act as
another Windows/super/mod key. The menu button (usually
between the right Alt and Ctrl) is an alternative Super/Mod
button. This is to make one-handing on laptops easier. If
you&rsquo;d like to change any of these keyboard changes,
you need only open and change the remaps script. All custom
scripts in LARBS are located in ~/.local/bin/. Actually,
this should go without saying, but <i>everything</i> here
can easily be changed. Below in this document, there is
information about where to change programs/components.
Additionally, while this isn&rsquo;t a part of the desktop
environment, the default editing mode in the shell is using
vi bindings. If you want to learn more of this, run Mod+F2
and type and select the option for &quot;vi mode in
shell&quot;. This setting can be changed if you don&rsquo;t
like it by deleting or commenting out the contents of
~/.config/inputrc. To the left, you&rsquo;ll see the numbers
of your current workspace/tag(s). On the right, you&rsquo;ll
see various system status notifiers, the date, volume, even
music and local weather if possible, etc. Each module on the
right of the statusbar is a script located in
~/.local/bin/statusbar/. You can see what they do and modify
them from there. I&rsquo;m sure you can figure it out. You
can also right click on the module to see what it does. The
program dwmblocks is what is run to generate the statusbar
from those scripts. You can edit its config/source code in
~/.local/src/dwmblocks/ to tell it what scripts/commands you
want it to display. Press mod+F2 at any time to get a menu
of programs to watch videos about streaming directly from
YouTube. You can also check the config files for programs
which detail a lot of the specific bindings. The window
manager dwm abstractly orders all of your windows into a
stack from most important to least based on when you last
manipulated it. dwm is an easy to use window manager, but
you should understand that it makes use of that stack
layout. If you&rsquo;re not familiar, I recommend you press
Mod+F2 and select the &quot;dwm&quot; option to watch my
brief tutorial (note that the bindings I discuss in the
video are the default dwm binds, which are different
(inferior) to those here). Notice also the case sensitivity
of the shortcutsTo type capital letters, hold down the Shift
key&mdash;that might sound like an obvious and condescending
thing to tell you, but there have literally been multiple
people (Boomers) who have emailed me asking how to type a
capital letter since caps lock isn&rsquo;t enabled. <br>
, Be sure you play around with these. Be flexible with the
basic commands and the system will grow on you quick.

buttons that some keyboards have (play and pause buttons,
screen brightness, email, web browsing buttons, etc.) to
what you would expect. Dotfiles/settings files are located
in ~/.config/, note that dotfiles to programs not included
in LARBS are there as well by requests of users. I do not
necessarily maintain all these dotfiles, but they remain as
legacy. Suckless programs, dwm (the window manager), st (the
terminal) and dmenu among others do not have traditional
config files, but have their source code location in
~/.local/src/. There you can modify their config.h files,
then sudo make install to reinstall. (You&rsquo;ll have to
restart the program to see its effects obviously.) As
mentioned above, LARBS makes some keyboard changes with the
remaps script. These settings may override your preferred
settings, so you should open this file and comment out
troublesome lines if you have issues. On fresh install, the
Linux audio system often mutes outputs. You may also need to
set your preferred default output sink which you can do by
the command line, or by selecting one with pulsemixer
(Mod+F4). Copying and pasting is always program-specific on
any system. In most graphical programs, copy and paste will
be the same as they are on Windows: ctrl-c and ctrl-v. In
the Linux terminal, those binds have other more important
purposes, so you can run man st to see how to copy and paste
in my terminal build. Additionally, I&rsquo;ve set vim to
use the clipboard as the default buffer, which means when
you yank or delete something in vim, it will be in your
system clipboard as well, so you can ctrl-v it into your
browser instance, etc. You can also paste material copied
from other programs into vim with the typical vim bindings.
The system will always read the file ~/.config/wall.png as
the wallpaper. The script setbg, if run on an image will set
it as the persistent background. When using the file
manager, you can simply hover over an image name and type bg
and this will run setbg. LARBS no longer deploys Xresource
by default, but check ~/.config/Xresources for a list of
color schemes you can activate or add your own. When you
save the file, vim will automatically update the
colorscheme. If you&rsquo;d like these colors activated by
default on login, there is a line in ~/.config/xprofile you
can uncomment to allow that. Or, if you want to use wal to
automatically generate colorschemes from your wallpapers,
just install it and setbg will automatically detect and run
it on startup and wallpaper change. LARBS comes with
mutt-wizard, which gives the ability to receive and send all
your email and keep an offline store of it all in your
terminal, without the need for browser. You can add email
accounts by running mw add. Once you have successfully added
your email address(es), you can open your mail with neomutt
which is also bound to Mod+e. You can sync your mail by
pressing Mod+F8 and you can set a cronjob to sync mail every
several minutes by running mw cron. You may also want to
install pam-gnupg-git, which can be set up to automatically
unlock your GPG key on login, which will allow you avoid
having put in a password to sync and send, all while keeping
your password safe and encypted on your machine. By default,
mpd, the music daemon assumes that ~/Music is your music
directory. This can be changed in ~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf.
When you add music to your music folder, you may have to run
mpc up in the terminal to update the database. mpd is
controlled by ncmpcpp, which is accessible by Mod+m. LARBS
is deployed as a git repository in your home directory. You
can use it as such to fetch, diff and merge changes from the
remote repository. If you don&rsquo;t want to do that or
don&rsquo;t know how to use git, you can actually just rerun
the script (as root) and reinstall LARBS and it will
automatically update an existing install if you select the
same username. This will overwrite the original config files
though, including changes you made for them, but this is an
easier brute force approach that will also install any new
dependencies. &ndash; For questions! &ndash; For stalking!
&ndash; To incentivize more development of LARBS! &ndash;
For the code behind it! &ndash; For updates!</p>
